Answer the following questions in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.



## Questions

1. Look up 'Data Scientist' at https://www.bls.gov/. What degree is required for this career? Is it a growing occupation?  

Bachelor's degree. It is growing much faster than average.

2. How would you describe your data science skills on a resume for a job application? Write a blurb that reflects the skills you have learned in this course. 

Comfortable in R coding language, able to do intermediate data cleaning and analysis.


3. What are your current career interests, and how could your R skills support that career path? (hint: this might be good content for your LinkedIn profile ;)


I am interested in going into biotechnology and being proficeint in R will certainly be useful.

4. What about this course has been the most difficult for you? What has been the most rewarding?

The most difficult has probably been the shiny apps. It is very satsisfying looking back on things that previously confused me and seeing that I fully understand it now.

5. What do you wish you had known, or what skills do you wish you had, before taking this class.

I wish I had known more about how Github worked.

6. If we had 1 more lab in this class, what would you have liked to learn more about?

I would have liked to learn about custom functions or for loops.

7. Now that you have (almost!) completed this course, do you plan to pursue further data or computer science skills? What do you plan to do?

I want to be able to apply my skills in lab with my own data or data from my lab mates.

8. How important was working with a partner to your success in this class? If this class were transitioned to an online format, how do you think that would affect your understanding?

I think it was very useful being able to ask each other if we got stuck. Being online might have made the class much harder.

9. Did you complete the class evaluation? Please complete the class evaluation using the link provided in the announcements. Your feedback is very important and we appreciate your time.

Yes!
